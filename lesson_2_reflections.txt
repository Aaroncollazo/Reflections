What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden folder holding meta data for your repository with information about the files in your repository. 
You need to do this to start creating commits and using git for version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets you seperate files from your repository to commit, and the working directory is all of the files in the repository. Alone the staging area does nothing you need to put files into it to commit.
