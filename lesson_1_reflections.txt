How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

why is this a question?
i guess we have to break this down into why are things different and did using your eyeballs let you see the difference
so i guess the answer is because of the video and questions i was able to look at two different pieces of text and determine they were not the same, and the new version had various unintented errors

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It obviously lets you see the revisions to compare to later. It also lets you use the previous versions to copy and ignore typing the same things again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

if we are working with code changing things as we enter them and saving everything is too risky. We might run into problems with the new versions and have no way to go back quickly.
so the only logical solution is to save manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

You just went over these reasons. Some files are related to eachother and care about functions accross eachother. Changing these together only makes sense

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

using the log function you can find specific changes based on their ID's and use the diff function to view the additions and subtractions between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

With every major change being saved you can rest easy that if you experiment you can always go back.

Mostly for debugging i think.
